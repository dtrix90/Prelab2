    <h1>Dominique Ghaffari</h1><br>
    <h4><p>I am 31 years old and I live in Malm√∂ with my boyfriend and our 10 year old cat.</p>
    <p>Beside my full time studies, I also work part-time as a dental hygienist in a town called Vellinge.</p>
    <p>Fun fact: I recieved that degree at HKR in 2014!</p>
    <p>I have no prior experience in programming or web development in general besides what I've been learning</p>
    <p>during my time here, which has been really valuable.</p>
    <p>So far I've been really enjoying the frontend course!</p></h3>
